% makeRegionSizeProjectionBBint2 : THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS makeRegSize,
% needs to be replaced in the code with that and deleted!

% INPUT :
%       mask : masked region of interest
%       props : contains information about the orientation of the region
% OUTPUT:
%       L1 : projection length of region on the major axis
%       L2 : projection length of region on the minor axis
